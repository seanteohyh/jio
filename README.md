# Jio

*Jio* — Singlish, "to invite someone along."

A progressive web app for the daily question nobody wants to be the one to ask:
**where are we eating?** It learns what you actually like from what you rate,
runs a ranked-choice vote when a group has to agree, and stays out of the way
the rest of the time.

Runs on free tiers end to end. Works on a phone and on a desktop, and installs
to a home screen.

---

## Quick start

You need Node 18 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

That is the whole setup. With no configuration at all the app runs in **demo
mode**: an in-memory store with 22 places around Bras Basah and Bugis, two
invented teammates with opinions, a lunch group, and one Jio mid-vote. No
accounts, no keys, no database. Everything resets when the dev server restarts.

When you are ready to make it real, see [Going live](#going-live).

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Suggest** | Ranks places on what you rate highly, what fits your budget, how far it is, and how recently you were there. Every suggestion says *why* it is there. |
| **Jios** | Create a lunch outing, everyone ranks the options, a Borda count decides. RSVP, live vote updates, and a roulette wheel for when the group genuinely cannot choose. |
| **Kakis** | Lunch groups with a shareable invite link and shared stats — group favourites, who eats out most, who is most adventurous. |
| **Places** | Searchable list with cuisine, budget and walk-time filters. Add places by hand, import candidate names from a food blog, or let the daily cron find them on OpenStreetMap. |
| **Map** | Leaflet map of everything in walking distance, with real walking routes when OneMap is configured. |
| **Reviews & recos** | Log a visit privately, or share it as a review. Separately, recommend a place to the team — it shows in the food pool and nudges the place up everyone's suggestions. |
| **Weather** | Checks the NEA two-hour forecast. When rain is likely, the walk penalty doubles and closer places quietly rise. |
| **Metrics** | What you actually eat versus what you think you eat, plus a nudge when you have had the same cuisine three days running. |

## How it is put together

The whole point of the structure is that you can replace any one piece without
touching the others.

```

### The seams

Everything swappable answers to an interface, and one factory picks the
implementation from an environment variable.

| Seam | Interface | Ships with | Set with |
|---|---|---|---|
| Database | `Repo` (`lib/data/index.ts`) | `demoRepo`, `supabaseRepo` | `JIO_DATA_ADAPTER` |
| Auth | `AuthAdapter` (`lib/auth/index.ts`) | `demoAuth`, `supabaseAuth` | `JIO_AUTH_ADAPTER` |
| Walking routes | `RoutingProvider` | OneMap, haversine | `JIO_ROUTING_PROVIDER` |
| Weather | `WeatherProvider` | NEA, none | `JIO_WEATHER_PROVIDER` |
| Place discovery | `DiscoveryProvider` | Overpass, none | `JIO_DISCOVERY_PROVIDER` |

**No page or API route imports a database client.** They call `getRepoAsync()`
and use the interface. That is what makes the next section a small job rather
than a rewrite.

### Moving to a different database

1. Write `src/lib/data/myRepo.ts` implementing the `Repo` interface.
2. Add `"mydb"` to the `DataAdapter` union in `src/lib/config/index.ts`.
3. Add a case to the switch in `src/lib/data/repo.ts`.

That is it. `tests/repoConformance.test.ts` will fail loudly if you miss a
method or change an arity, so a half-finished port cannot ship quietly.

The same three steps apply to auth, routing, weather and discovery.

### Feature flags

Every optional slice can be switched off without deleting code. Disabling one
hides its navigation entry *and* makes its API routes return 404 — so a
stripped build has no half-live endpoints.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_JIO_DISABLED_FEATURES=kakis,blogImport,roulette
```

Valid keys: `events`, `kakis`, `wishlist`, `recos`, `blogImport`, `discovery`,
`weather`, `map`, `metrics`, `roulette`, `reviews`, `offices`.

## How the recommendation engine thinks

Seven weighted components, all in `src/lib/recommend.ts`, all pure functions.
Every tunable number lives in `src/lib/recommendConfig.ts` — you can change the
app's whole personality in one file.

| Component | Weight | What it is for |
|---|---:|---|
| Cuisine affinity | 2.0 | What you rate highly, learned from your history, plus anything you explicitly liked or disliked. |
| Bayesian rating | 1.5 | Community and personal ratings, smoothed toward a prior so one glowing review does not beat forty good ones. |
| Budget fit | 1.0 | In range, one tier out, or out. |
| Walk penalty | 1.0 | Free for the first five minutes, then a cost per minute, floored. Doubles when rain is likely. |
| Variety | 1.2 | Rewards somewhere new, penalises somewhere you went yesterday, and lets a favourite come back as the memory fades. |
| Wishlist | 1.0 | Saving something makes it more likely to be suggested. |
| Teammate reco | 1.0 | Someone vouched for it. |

Three things are hard exclusions rather than penalties: a blocked place, a
place on your personal blocklist, and a place whose *every* cuisine you have
marked as one you would rather not eat.

**Group mode** scores each member separately and averages. A place excluded by
any single member is excluded for the group — one person's hard no outranks
everyone else's mild preference.

### Why Borda and not "most votes"

Plurality voting picks whatever the loudest minority wants. With six people and
five options, a place three people love and three people refuse can win with a
plurality while making half the table unhappy. Borda asks everyone to rank and
rewards broad acceptability, which is the actual goal when a group has to eat
together.

A voter who ranks *N* options gives *N* points to their first choice down to 1
for their last. Partial ballots are fine and are scaled by that voter's own
ballot length, so ranking three options does not buy more influence than
ranking all six. Ties break on points, then on first-place votes, then at
random.

## Going live

Roughly 30 minutes end to end. Everything below stays on a free tier.

### 1. Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (Free plan).
2. **Project Settings → API** — note the Project URL, the `anon` key, and the
   `service_role` key. The last one is a secret; it bypasses all access
   control.
3. **SQL Editor** — run every file in `supabase/migrations/` in numeric order,
   001 through 014. They are idempotent, so re-running is harmless.
4. **Authentication → Providers → Email** — enable it, with magic links on.
5. **Authentication → URL Configuration** — set the Site URL to your deployed
   URL, and add `http://localhost:3000` to the redirect URLs for local work.

### 2. Email delivery (do not skip this)

Supabase's built-in email service is rate limited to a handful of messages an
hour and is explicitly not for production. Since sign-in *is* email, that limit
is the thing most likely to make the app look broken to your colleagues.

Set up custom SMTP under **Project Settings → Authentication → SMTP Settings**.
[Resend](https://resend.com) and [Brevo](https://brevo.com) both have free
tiers well beyond what a team of this size needs.

### 3. OneMap (optional)

Register free at [onemap.gov.sg](https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/register)
for real walking distances. Without it the app falls back to straight-line
estimates, which run about 20–30% optimistic in a dense area — everything still
works, the numbers are just softer.

### 4. Deploy

Push to GitHub, import the repo at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), and add
the environment variables. Vercel detects Next.js with no configuration.

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | From step 1 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | From step 1 |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | From step 1 — secret |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` | `false` |
| `CRON_SECRET` | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `ONEMAP_EMAIL` / `ONEMAP_PASSWORD` | Optional, from step 3 |

Then go back to Supabase and set the Site URL to your live URL.

### 5. Seed some places

```bash
npm run seed:manual      # 25 hand-picked spots around Bras Basah / Bugis
npm run seed:overpass    # everything OSM knows about nearby → review queue
npm run seed:walktimes   # compute and cache walking times
```

All three read `.env.local` and exit cleanly with a message if Supabase is not
configured, rather than failing.

### 6. Check it worked

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/discover
# {"fetched":45,"new":3,"skipped":42,...}
```

Then sign in, open `/suggest`, and confirm you get picks with reasons attached.

## Free-tier realities

Things that will bite eventually. None are urgent at team scale, but you should
know they exist before they surprise you.

**Supabase pauses a free project after 7 days with no queries.** The daily
discovery cron queries the database on every run, which keeps the project
awake. This is not a side effect — it is half of why that cron exists. If you
disable discovery, add some other daily ping.

**Vercel Hobby runs crons at most once a day.** `vercel.json` is set to 02:00
UTC accordingly. For anything more frequent, point an external scheduler such
as [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) at `/api/cron/discover` with the same
bearer token.

**Rating aggregates are computed in the application, not the database.**
`listPlaces()` pulls the visits and averages them in JavaScript. Fine for a
team; it will get slow somewhere in the tens of thousands of visits. The fix
when you get there is a materialised view or a trigger-maintained column, and
it is contained entirely within `supabaseRepo.listPlaces()`.

**OSM coverage is uneven.** Some entries are long-closed businesses, some are
vending machines tagged as cafés. Everything discovered lands in a
`needs_review` queue and never reaches suggestions until a human confirms it.
The 25 curated places in `scripts/manual-seed.json` are the fallback.

**OneMap tokens last 72 hours.** They are cached in memory and refreshed 12
hours early; a 401 clears the cache and retries once. If it still fails, the
app falls back to haversine rather than showing an error.

---

## Security notes

**Row Level Security is the access control, not the application code.** The
server-side data client always uses the anon key, so every query is subject to
RLS. `tests/clients.test.ts` asserts it never falls back to the service-role
key, even when that key is sitting in the environment — that silent-escalation
bug is exactly the kind that works fine in development and leaks everything in
production.

**The service-role client has one caller.** `/api/cron/discover`, which needs
to write to the review queue with no user session. The module throws at import
time if it is ever bundled for the browser.

**Blog import is SSRF-guarded.** `validateBlogUrl()` rejects localhost, all the
private IPv4 ranges, link-local (which is where cloud metadata endpoints live),
and the IPv6 equivalents — including IPv4-mapped addresses in both their dotted
and hex spellings, since `new URL()` silently normalises one into the other.
One limitation to be aware of: it does not resolve DNS, so a public hostname
that resolves to a private address would still pass. Pin egress at the network
layer if that matters to you.

**Some SELECT policies are permissive on purpose.** Any authenticated user can
read events, options, kakis and profiles. Invite tokens are unguessable, so
possession of an id already implies an invite, and the alternative — recursive
membership checks inside policies — needs `SECURITY DEFINER` helper functions
that are much easier to get subtly wrong. Writes are owner-scoped throughout.

**Adding a place to a Jio is checked twice.** Once in the repo, for a readable
error message, and once in the RLS policy from migration 013, which is the
actual gate. Host, kaki member or explicit invitee, and only while the event is
open.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `recommend.test.ts` | Every scoring component, exclusions, ranking, boosts, group mode |
| `blogImport.test.ts` | HTML extraction and the full SSRF matrix |
| `eventAdditions.test.ts` | Who can add, remove, invite, vote and close |
| `metrics.test.ts` | User and group statistics, cuisine streaks |
| `discovery.test.ts` | OSM normalisation and deduplication |
| `voting.test.ts` | Borda count, partial ballots, tie-breaking |
| `weather.test.ts` | Rain detection and weather-aware ranking |
| `clients.test.ts` | The Supabase client factories cannot escalate privilege |
| `repoConformance.test.ts` | Both repos implement the same interface |

---

## Not built yet

In rough priority order.

1. **Onboarding polish for display names.** A new user is seeded from their
   email local part. It works, but the first-run prompt to set a real name
   should be more prominent than a field on `/profile`.
2. **Office management UI.** The schema supports unlimited offices and the
   switcher works, but adding one in production means the small form or a SQL
   insert. An admin view would be better.
3. **Materialised view for ratings.** See "Free-tier realities" above.
4. **Push notifications.** "Vote closes in 10 minutes" is the obvious use.
   Needs VAPID keys, a service-worker push handler, and something to send them
   — a Supabase Edge Function or a second Vercel cron.
5. **Custom domain.** Currently `*.vercel.app`. Point DNS, add the domain in
   Vercel, then update the Supabase Site URL and redirect URLs.
